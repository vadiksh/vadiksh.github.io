Parallax that doesn't suck! No jQuery required, just plain 'ol javascript.

Smooth Parallax makes it easy to move objects when you scroll, being it images, divs or what-have-you. Use it to add that background or foreground parallax effect to your website or create a [moving scene with a hippie van](https://diegoversiani.me/smooth-parallax/) :)

## Installation

Setting up is pretty straight-forward. Just download the script from __dist__ folder and include it in your HTML:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/smooth-parallax.min.js"></script>
```

Smooth Parallax also supports AMD / CommonJS

```js
// AMD
require(["path/to/smooth-parallax"], function(SmoothParallax) {});

// CommonJS
var SmoothParallax = require("smooth-parallax");
```

### NPM / Bower

Smooth Parallax is also available on NPM and Bower:

```sh
npm install smooth-parallax      # npm
bower install smooth-parallax    # bower
```

## Basic Usage

__Init__

Just call `SmoothParallax.init()` to get objects moving and configure elements movement.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.addEventListener("load", function () {
    SmoothParallax.init();
  });
</script>
```

Smooth Parallax will automatically look for all objects with the attribute `smooth-parallax` (ie.: `<img src="images/hippie-van.png" smooth-parallax="">`).

__Configure elements movement__

You'll also have to set at least one more attribute `start-position` or `end-position`, see options at [standard options](#standard-options).

## Standard Options

__Global Options__

These options are passed to the `init` function when starting Smooth Parallax.

- `basePercentageOn` Set how you want to track scroll percentage:
    - `containerVisibility` __default__: scroll percentage for each moving object is calculated only when the element's container is visible in the viewport. This prevents objects from moving while not visible.
    - `pageScroll`: scroll percentage is based on the page scroll and is the same for all moving objects.

__Elements Options__

These options are passed as html attributes to the moving elements and define how that element movement behaves.

All percentage values are in decimal form, ie.: `1 = 100%`. You can also set values greater than 1 and smaller than 0, ie.: `-0.5 = -50%` or `1.25 = 125%`.

- `start-movement` - define at what scroll percentage to start moving the object. Default value is `0.0`;
- `end-movement` - define at what scroll percentage to stop moving the object. Default value is `1.0`.
- `start-position-x` - define the horizontal start position of the element in percentage of its the base-size (see option below).
- `start-position-y` - define the vertical start position of the element in percentage of its the base-size (see option below).
- `end-position-x` - define the horizontal end position of the element in percentage of its the base-size (see option below).
- `end-position-y` - define the vertical end position of the element in percentage of its the base-size (see option below).
- `container` - change the elements container element user to calculate its position, default is moving element's parent node.
- `base-size` - define how to calculate the base size of the movement, used to calculate the target position.
    - `elementSize`: calculate based on the element size itself.
    - `containerSize`: calculate based on the elements container size.
