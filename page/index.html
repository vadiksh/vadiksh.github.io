		<p class="jolted__text">You know, sometimes I feel like I am the only one that has had this issue, and the only one that ever will. At least I never met anyone that had such severe procrastination and time-wasting issues as myself.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">Are you familiar with it? Here is a small description, by yours truly, in chat form:</p><br>

‎12/4/18, 3:42 AM - Kenneth Dale: This is what i do when i am stressed <br>
‎12/4/18, 3:42 AM - Kenneth Dale: It is almost like i cannot control myself <br>
‎12/4/18, 3:42 AM - Kenneth Dale: Self-sabotage mode <br>

‎12/4/18, 4:16 AM - Kenneth Dale: Perfect logic right there <br>
‎12/4/18, 4:16 AM - Leila: Try to go to sleep now.. 1 to 2 hours wouldnt be bad than no sleep at all. <br>

‎12/4/18, 4:20 AM - Kenneth Dale: About this <br>
‎12/4/18, 4:20 AM - Leila Mapilisan Philippines: Sometimes, resolving an issue will have to start from least to greatest. Go and sleep, Ken. Rest your mind for now. <br>
‎12/4/18, 4:21 AM - Kenneth Dale: Yep <br>
‎12/4/18, 4:22 AM - Kenneth Dale: Have a good day</p>
		<p class="jolted__text">And, by the way, I happen to be writing this at 5 AM on the same day of this chat conversation. I have a meeting at around 9:30 AM.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">In my college years, about 8-10 years ago, I used to stay awake until 5 minutes before my class. I would do my homework about 10 minutes before class, after having procrastinated all night.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">I literally watched YouTube videos, news, played games, and other instant-gratification stuff, all night.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">Unable to go to sleep, because that would mean resigning to doing my work, something that my conscience could not tolerate. But unable to do my work, because something about it stressed me out… or created work anxiety. Internal conflict perhaps? Maybe my work wasn’t really aligned with my deepest dreams, and my inner self wanted to sabotage this work by refusing to do it? </p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">The inner conflict that would reach a deadlock of inaction… of total paralysis… and of complete life disarray.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">I had 4 years of that in college. I reached my lowest points then, had suicidal thoughts… but my family loved me so much that I didn’t want to hurt them by killing myself. It was almost the only thing that kept me from doing it, though. I could not understand why I kept wasting so much damn time.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">Staying up all night on the computer doing nothing? Or shall I say, doing random stuff that distracted me from the real stuff I needed to face: real life stuff. Stuff that I just didn’t want to look in the face.</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">I was too overwhelmed by it to be able to see beyond the immediate present. My emotional self controlled my actions and surpassed all kind of logic. People who saw me in this behavior, were awed. “Kenny just sits there, but he doesn’t work.”</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">Does this sound like you?</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">Well, as I said… I never met anyone that had the magnitude of procrastination that I had. But if there is anyone out there that is suffering from the same symptoms… endless time wasting without being able to control it: I want to say something:</p><br>
		<p class="jolted__text">I love you. I am with you. And I feel your pain. I know, deep in my heart, how painful it is to feel you have no control… to see your life fall into disarray before your eyes. To feel like a spectator in a never ending nightmare. To see your potential crumble in every minute, and to see time squandered shamelessly. The potential killer. The soul destroyer. That nemesis that I had for years. Again I must say: I am with you, and I feel your pain. I love you. And I want you to know that you are not alone. I have lived through this and this is for you.</p><br>
