				<h3>The wild west</h3>
				<p>Journey to the Wild West of Wells Gray Provincial Park and witness spectacular beauty and awe-inspiring natural wonders.  It’s one of British Columbia’s largest and most spectacular wilderness parks (540,000 hectares) and is home to a large black bear population.  This is one of the best places in BC for black bear watching!</p>
				<p>The Wells Gray Guest Ranch, our home and historic dude ranch, has specialized in summer vacations since 1984. The Ranch is one of the oldest operated guest ranches in the valley and is inside Wells Gray Park boundaries approximately 27 km from Clearwater, alongside the park road. The ranch’s proximity to the Wells Gray Park makes it an ideal destination to hang your hat and get acquainted with the beautiful Wild West.</p>
				<p>We encourage our guests to take advantage of the wonderful opportunity the ranch presents with being so close to the Park. To be able to see so many different species of animals and plants as well as the famous waterfalls is quite phenomenal, without the crowds and hustle. Enjoy a truly peaceful night, with nothing breaking the silence, except the sounds of nature.</p>
				<p>Wells Gray Guest Ranch offers the very best in western hospitality. The friendliness and hospitality, vital for survival in this remote area of British Columbia during pioneer days, is maintained until today. You will find the Old West alive in our Black Horse Saloon and enjoy the Western Style atmosphere in our outdoor Chuck Wagon patio.<br>Adventure Activities like horseback riding, hiking, canoeing, river rafting and wildlife viewing are all part of the ranch's daily summer routine. Your skilled guide will lead you to adventures on remote mountains, valleys and lakes in a setting as spectacular as it is challenging.</p>

					<h3>Answer</h3>
					<p>Typically during the months of July and August we are full with a total of 20 to 30 guests in the Log Cabin Rooms, and another up to 50 guests at the campground and Fort Wells Gray Rustic Cabins.</p>
					<p>Wells Gray Ranch has guests from around the world. A large percentage of our guests come from Europe (A, D, NL, F), but also Australia and Canada.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately not! We do not have cell phone reception in this Valley.</p>
					<p>Wireless Satellite Internet is available for a surcharge at the main building. Please note that as it is satellite access, the connection can be lost from time to time due to weather conditions. We do not have a device for you to use & must supply your own.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately yes, during summer mosquitoes and sometimes black flies are common hiking companions. However, at the beginning of August they virtually disappear.</p>
					<p>It’s recommended. However, you can decide a day prior what you want to do. In the height of season, spaces on any of the offered excursions are limited and booking ahead is recommended.</p>
					<p class="active">There is a TV monitor in the Deluxe Log Cabins only. We do not have TV. You are welcome to rent a movie at the desk. However, it’s our experience you will be so busy you will not have time to watch a movie.</p>
					<p>We keep our rides as small as possible. Most rides will have 4-6 guests and one wrangler. Rides never exceed 8 guests.</p>
					<p>One-third of our guests have never been on a horse before. All of the Wranglers are trained instructors and will help you as much as you need. We strive to suit riders to a horse that will match their ability level. Riding is something we all do here at the ranch and we wish to share this experience with our guests.</p>
					<p>The country we ride in is vast with a large number of trails. For your safety and the horse’s safety, all of the rides are guided.</p>
					<p>We only allow faster rides if you have ridden with us for one full day or two half day rides and if your ability and experience so allows. Most of our trips have to be suitable for the amateur adventurer and therefore we do not trot or gallop horses with beginners.</p>
					<p>Helmets are available for anyone that would like one. Kids 16 years and under are required to wear a helmet while riding.</p>
