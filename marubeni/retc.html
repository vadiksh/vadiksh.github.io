                    <h3>Renewable Energy Test Center</h3>
                </div>
                <h3 class="title2">Bankability Studies: Knowing Your Risks</h3>
                <p>It’s  no  secret  that  renewable  energy  has  been  booming.  The  use of  solar  power  alone  has quadrupled  in  the  past  five  years  and  is  forecasted  to double again in  the  next  five  years. Government  policies  have  had varying effects on the  popularity  of  renewable  energy.  Tax  incentives and  green-energy  mandates  enacted have both helped and hindered the growth. </p>
									<br>
                <p>At the same time,  renewable  energy  tech  also  has  its  risks,  and  the  biggest  one  may  come  from  companies that  tend  to  invest  much  time  and  resources  into  projects  without  doing  suitable  research. The  lack  of  investigation — from  engineering  and  contracting,  to  actual  building  and  the generation  and  distribution  of  equipment — can  quickly  tank  a  project. Such  is  the  case  for  many  projects  that  include  photovoltaic  (PV)  panels,  which  turn  the sun’s  photons  into  electrons  that  power  a  home,  cell  phone,  or  automobile.  Before  backing a  project,  investors  need  to  ask:  Will  it  be  able  to  generate  the  estimated  amount  of  energy? How  long  will  it  last?  Will  it  burst  into  flames  in  a  few  years?  When  it  comes  to  solar modules, financiers need answers  to  these  questions — and  they  simply can not  rely  on  an  energy  company’s  guarantee  of  success.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dt_col dt_colbg" style="background-image:url(resources/retc/1.jpg); background-position: 25% 25%;"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="dtable">

            <div class="dt_col" >
                <p>Manufacturers  may  guarantee  that  their  modules  will last  up  to  25  years;  but  who’s  to  say  the  company  itself  will  be  around  in  25  years?  Cherif Kedir,  co-founder  and  CEO  of  bankability  and certification  firm  Renewable  Energy  TestCenter,  or  RETC,  is  all  too  familiar  with  this  scenario.</p>
									<br>
                <p>“Not  every  module  maker  is  the  same,”  he  says.  “There  are  some  who  use  substandard materials  to  cut  costs.  When  you  do  that,  you  introduce  a  much  higher  risk in  the  modules; they  could  catch  fire  and  endanger  people.”</p>
									<br>
                <p>Enter:  Bankability  studies.  They  provide  an  in-depth  examination  of  a  project’s  potential  for success:  looking  at  its  feasibility  with  regard  to  the  company’s  resources,  how  it  will generate  enough  cash  flow  to  justify  costs,  and  if  it  will  remain  viable  in  the  long-term.  In short,  bankability  studies  best  describe  to  investors  the  financial  risks  of  a  project.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="dtable">
            <div class="dt_col">
                <p>“In  bankability  testing,  we  extend  the  tests  that  are  required  under  the  certification guidelines,  two  to  three  times,”  says  Kedir.  “We  even  introduce  additional  tests  to  ensure that  the  modules  will  last  25  years  and  beyond.”</p>
									<br>
                <p>For  manufacturers  juggling slim  margins,  and  investors  facing  numerous  risks,  failure  is  acostly  mistake.  Dr.  Ralph  Romero,  senior  managing  director  of  Kansas-based  engineering and  construction  giant  Black  &  Veatch  Management  Consulting  (B&V)  PV  evaluation practice,  can  cite  numerous  instances  when  panel  problems  and  failures  could  have  been prevented  if  only  manufacturers  did  bankability  studies — and  listened  to  its  feedback.  “[In one  case,  a]  client  did  not  implement  all  of  them,  which  led  to  a  recall  of  over  a  million modules  in the  field,”  he  recalls.  “We’re  talking  about  a  liability  to  the  tune  of  $150  million dollars.”</p>

                <h3 class="title2">“That’s one of the advantages of working with us”</h3>
                <p>The  importance  of  bankability  studies  cannot  be  understated,  and  RETC  acknowledges  this.  Created  in  2009  by  former  computer  and  semiconductor  engineers  Kedir  and  Alelie  Funcell,  RETC  is  now  one  of  the  top  firms  in  the  bankability  sector,  with  a  significant share  of  the  US  market.  In  March  2018,  Japanese  trading  company  Marubeni  acquired  a  70%  stake  in  the  company.</p>
									<br>
                <p>Kedir  says:  “We  realized  that  there  was  a  severe  need  in  the  industry  to  guide  companies  through  the  certification  process,  as  well  as  reliability  testing,  proof  of  concept,  durability  testing,  and  market  introduction.”</p>
									<br>
                <p>RETC  doesn’t  compete  on  cost.  Instead,  they  stand  by  the  quality  of  their  work,  customer service,  and  speed.  A  project  takes  about  three  to  five  months  to  finish,  with  data  gathered  within  three  US  test  sites,  as  well  as  other  countries  like  India,  the  Philippines,  and  Chile.  Best  of  all,  customers  have  real-time  access  to  data  as  tests  are  completed. </p>
									<br>
                <p>“That’s  one  of  the  advantages  of  working  with  us,”  says  RETC  engineering  director Emmanuel  Siason.  “You  don’t  have  to  wait  months  to  find  out  if  something  is  wrong.  This  is  important,  so  manufacturers  can  correct  mistakes  at  once.”</p>
            </div>

        <div class="dtable">
            <div class="dt_col">
                 <h3 class="title2">Reliable Data</h3>
                <p>In 2017, B&V partnered up with RETC to jointly evaluate, rank, and characterize double-sided bi-facial solar panels. B&V, which had revenues of $3.4 billion that same year, wanted to partner up with a company that could provide it with reliable and trusted test data and RETC not only met but exceeded their requirements.</p>
									<br>
								<p>Currently, RETC and B&V are working with the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to create and/or validate an accurate predictive models for bifacial generation. In addition to the expansion into bifacial panels, RETC has partnered up with leading research institutes and certification agencies, such as Fraunhofer and VDE to developing bankability tests for energy storage systems based on lithium-ion batteries; these technologies are used in a variety of applications from mobility applications, such as bikes, automobiles and buses, to home and utility-scale storage and solar generation.</p>
									<br>
								<p>“It was important for us to establish a relationship with a trustworthy test lab experienced in PV, with a high reputation in the field and for professionalism," says Romero. "That led us to RETC.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dt_col dt_colbg" style="background-image:url(resources/retc/5.jpg)"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="dtable">
            <div class="dt_col dt_colbg" style="background-image:url(resources/retc/6.jpg)"></div>
            <div class="dt_col">
                <p>These  panels,  which  can  be  placed  vertically,  such  as  on  highway  sound  barriers,  look  to  revolutionize  solar,  much  the  same  way  that  trackers  did.  And  while  there  isn’t  an  accurate  predictive  model  for  bifacial  generation  that  lenders  trust  yet,  he  expects  one  will  be  available  within  the  next  two  years.  RETC  and  B&V  are  working  with  the  U.S.  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory  on  that  model.</p>
									<br>
								<p>In  addition  to  the  expansion  into  bifacial, RETC  is  moving  ahead to  start  the  same  type  of  certification  and  bankability  tests  for  energy  storage  systems,  namely  those  based  on  lithium-ion  batteries,  which  are  used  in  utility-scale  storage  and  home  solar generation.  That storage  market  growth  forecast  is  “phenomenal,”  says  Kedir.  </p>
									<br>
								<p>Marubeni is optimistic for the company's outlook and its potential to help the trading company evaluate the latest in solar and battery technology and integrate that into its global renewables and machinery businesses.  This is a critical requirement for Marubeni and a major component in ensuring the reliability and reducing risks associated with long term solar power plant investments.</p>
									<br>
                <p>“Whether  it’s  the  spread  of  solar  power  plants,  distributed  electricity  generation,  or  fast-chargers  coupled  with  better  storage,”  says  RETC  chairman  Daisuke  Matsukado,  “moving  towards  a  low-carbon  society,  we  want  to  build  on  RETC’s  expertise.</p>
