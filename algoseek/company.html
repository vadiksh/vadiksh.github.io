                <p>In 2014, after 7+ years of developing high frequency trading systems, Chris and Yuri were continually hearing from colleagues about the pain of sourcing affordable high quality data for research and testing. Data from top vendors was like an expensive house that looks gorgeous on the surface but is incomplete upon close inspection with many pieces missing. The team decided to provide high quality data sets, ready for machine learning and Al that are also affordable.</p>

                <h3>This is how we started our journey.</h3>
                <p>While developing quant trading software and algo systems we had the constant challenge of sourcing affordable high quality data for research and testing. Data from top vendors was like an expensive house that looks gorgeous on the surface but is incomplete upon close inspection with many pieces missing.</p>

                <h3>We are solving this for firms and quants by building high quality yet affordable data sets ready for research and backtesting.</h3>
                <p>Our high frequency fund agreed to a spin out of a new data firm with our team and the already existing historical raw data sets and software.</p>
                <p>We continue to collect data at major financial data centers and continuously add new datasets to help researchers focus on research and not data manipulation, for example AlgoSeek's aggregated minute bar data sets with 50+ fields per bar designed for machine learning and Al.</p>

                <h3>There are many different cheeses in the market, because people need different flavors.</h3>
                <p>On the contrary, milk is a relatively "standard" product with a consistent flavor. There are many different dairy brands because each producer has limited lands and cows and relatively fixed variable costs.</p>

                <h3>News service is like cheese; Ultra low latency market data is similar to milk.</h3>
                <p>Historical market data is neither cheese nor milk. There are good data and bad data, there are expensive data and fairly-priced data, but the market doesn't need many flavor varieties for historical data. And the variable costs is close to zero.</p>
                <p>There are lots of historical market data vendors out there mostly because of information asymmetry. Data is hard to compare. People don't know which is best choice.</p>

                <h3>But the era of Al and machine learning is coming.</h3>
                <p>ML needs simplicity. ML also needs sophistication. A real data expert knows what are relevant and what are not. All the mistakes, data holes, inconsistencies, etc., will be exposed under the exhaustive scrutiny of algo testing and machine learning.</p>
                <p>Al is still stupid, but will not be stupid forever.</p>
                <p>When the inflection point comes, vendors of quality data will shine. This article is not really about vision. This is about our understandings and beliefs.</p>
